HackWinds
=====================

Hi, this is my fork of the hackwinds rhode island surf app. I liked the look of
mpiannucci's app, and thought I would try to adapt this app for surfers in
Bermuda. I thought it would be a fun project and a  way for me to try making an
android app, thereby learning things.

For the moment, I am working on changing the data so that it points to Bermuda.
I'll try to find alternate sources for the information, but I don't know of any
webcams in Bermuda at the moment, and there aren't wave buoys particularly close
to Bermuda, but I'll try to work this stuff out.

Disclaimer 
----------------

I do not own or claim to own neither the wave camera images or the forecast
information displayed in this app. This app is simply an interface to make
checking the waves easier for surfers when using a phone. I am speifically
operating within the user licensing for the Wunderground API.
